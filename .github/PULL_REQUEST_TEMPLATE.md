- [ ] **N-1 (Prevent production outages)** - I have verified this code works against all other fe-apps and services set to production
- [ ] **This PR makes API changes**.
  - [ ] I have documented these changes under the API Changes heading.
  - [ ] (Optional) I have confirmed with mobile that it is safe to make these changes.
- [ ] I have reviewed and understand the [Pull Request and Code Review Guidelines](https://tophat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOP/pages/2791964908/Pull+Request+and+Code+Review+Guidelines).

### Tests
<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- [ ] Added test(s) to cover the code added

### Code Review
- This PR addresses comments from a previous PR (insert link to previous PR)

### Sentry
- [ ] I have verified that there are no new **backend** issues logged in [Local Sentry](https://tophat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOP/pages/15796187/How+to+access+things+in+your+dev+env#Accessing-Sentry). (Note, local Sentry doesn't work for Apple M1/local docker.)

### SQL Queries
<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- [ ] Django ORM queries have been added.
- [ ] I have reviewed the SQL generated by these new ORM queries.
- [ ] I have reviewed the changes/additions for performance issues.
- [ ] If I'm unsure of the performance characteristics, I've run `EXPLAIN` on the new queries. <!-- See the MySQL docs for info on using EXPLAIN:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/using-explain.html -->

### Celery tasks:
- [ ] This PR removes a celerybeat task and I have followed the [documentation](https://tophat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOP/pages/935100476/Disabling+beat+tasks).

### Migrations:
<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- [ ] This PR contains migrations.
- [ ] I have completed [the migration checklist](https://tophat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOP/pages/1085636712/Migration+Testing).
- [ ] The migrations are ["N-1" compatible](https://tophat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOP/pages/15666089/N-1+Compatibility): code deployment is required together with the migration. <!-- Common causes: new, non-nullable columns without default values specified in the SQL schema; deleting columns when the previous code version has a Django model definition that still includes those columns; etc. See http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2014/05/06/database-migrations-done-right/ for some more information. -->

### API changes
<!-- Changes to the models (especially critical ones such as Question,
Course, etc.) can result in changes in the API. -->

<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- [ ] API endpoints or MODELS have changed.

### Requirements:
<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- [ ] `requirements.txt` was updated.
- [ ] `pip.tophat.com` contains [newly added/updated packages](https://tophat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOP/pages/15959402/Update+Pip+Tophat+Com+With+New+Requirements).
- [ ] I have accounted for possible N-1 issues where packages have externally persistent effects. (For example, the new version of a package uses a different serialization format, but we may still be using it on data serialized in the old format. This includes DB storage, cookies, cache -- anything external to Python memory.)

### 3rd party libraries
<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- These 3rd party libraries have been added:
    + <!-- library -->

### Data Corruption:
<!-- Delete items that do not apply. -->
- [ ] This PR fixes code that was creating inconsistent, corrupt, or unusable data and also contains a data migration that fixes the corrupt data that could have been introduced by the broken code

### Notes:
- Any other notes that code reviewers should be aware of

<!-- IMPORTANT: For special notes for deployment, i.e.
special instructions that must be followed during a release,
you must file a Jira ticket under this PR's Epic with details
and assign it to Devops. Please talk with DevOps
about how to do this your first time.

DO NOT simply note the instructions in the PR,
it's not visible enough during a release. -->
